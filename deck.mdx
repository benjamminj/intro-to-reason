## Reason

<AppearList>
  <li>🐪 Syntax extension of OCaml</li>
  <li>⚛️ Same creator as React</li>
  <li>🎉 Uses a familiar syntax & workflows</li>
</AppearList>

---

## OCaml 

<AppearList>
  <li>Battle-hardened over 20 years</li>
  <li>Immutable & functional by default</li>
  <li>Still allows imperative & mutable code</li>
</AppearList>

```notes
Since reason is a syntax for OCaml, we get all of this for free.

Ocaml is only 1/2 the picture, though. 

After all, this is a JS meetup, how does Reason come into the JS ecosystem?
```

---
## OCaml (cont.)
<AppearList>
    <li>Strong type system & inference</li>
  <li>Compiles to assembly, iOS, Android, & Web</li>
</AppearList>

# BuckleScript
### Compile Reason/OCaml into human readable, optimized JavaScript.

```notes
BuckleScript is a compiler for OCaml --> JS

Since Reason is just a syntax _for_ OCaml, it can easily leverage this tool that already existed within the OCaml ecosystem to allow cross-platform ability instantly.

BuckleScript does a lot of optimizations under the hood, since it's not trying to do 1:1 conversions into JS.
```

# Is all this really necessary?

```notes
Short answer: no, it's not necessary. but good? yes.

Cons: 

steeper learning curve, 

new syntax, 

new ecosystem, 

all for the promise of more scalable codebases.

NOTE: good place to do a VERY QUICK comparison w/ TypeScript
```
---

> Reason might not be right for your codebase yet, but it's worth keeping an eye on. 

```notes
Pros: 

well-maintained by FB, 

100% type coverage, 

better FP support in the language itself, 

THE LANGUAGE ENCOURAGES YOU TO REFACTOR!
```

# Syntax

export default FullScreenCodeWithTitle

## Functions

```reason
let add = (first, second) => first + second;

add(1, 2) /* 3 */
```

---
export default FullScreenCodeWithTitle

## Currying!

```reason
let mult = (a, b) => a * b;
/* let mult = a => b => a * b; */

let times3 = mult(3);
let num = times3(4);
```
---
export default FullScreenCodeWithTitle

## Labelled arguments

```reason
let addText = (~addition, ~text) => text ++ addition;

addText(~addition="sweet!", ~text="labelled arguments are")
/* "labelled arguments are sweet!" */
```

```notes
Make sure to say something about the ++ operator.
Simulation of this in JS is with an object as the argument, however, it can be very verbose to type-check, no inference.
```
---
export default FullScreenCodeWithTitle

## Records

```reason
type animal = {
  rank: int,
  species: string
};

let dog = {
  rank: 1,
  species: "Dog",
};
```

```notes
Make small note about record typing being inferred
```
---
export default FullScreenCodeWithTitle

## Records with Type

```reason
let cat: animal = {
  rank: 2,
  species: "Cat",
};
```
---
export default FullScreenCodeWithTitle

## Lists & Arrays

```reason
/* Lists are immutable */
let list = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let addedList = [0, ...list];

/* 
 * Arrays are mutable.
 * Also faster at random access/updates
 */
let arr = [|"my", "little", "array"|];
arr[2] = "pony";

/* arr = [|"my", "little", "pony"|] */
```

---
export default FullScreenCodeWithTitle

## Variant!

```reason
let Vehicle = 
  | Car(string)
  | Plane
  | Boat;

let toyota = Car("Toyota");
```

---
export default FullScreenCodeWithTitle

## Pattern Matching!

```reason
let getTransportation = (vehicle) => 
  switch(vehicle) {
    | Car(make) => "Travelling in a " ++ make ++ " on land! 🚗"
    | Boat => "Get your sea legs on 🚢"
    | Plane => "We're flying! ✈️"
  }

getTransportation(Car("Mercedes"));
/* "Travelling in a Mercedes on land! 🚗" */
```

---
export default FullScreenCodeWithTitle

## More Pattern Matching!

```reason
let getPostRecommendation = (posts) => {
  switch(posts) {
    | [] => "there aren't any posts!"
    | [articleName, ..._rest] when articleName == "Intro to Reason" => 
      "Check this out! It's sweet!"
    | [articleName] => articleName ++ " is your only option."
    | [firstName, secondName, ..._rest] => 
      "try" ++ firstName ++ " or " ++ secondName
  }
};

getPostRecommendation(["Intro to Reason"]);
```

```notes
When we start pattern matching on more data structs, the only JS equivalent is a whole lot of if/elses

There's currently a JS proposal for pattern-matching, but it's not quite ready yet.
```
---
export default FullScreenCodeWithTitle

## Pipes

```reason
let add3 = (a) => a + 3;
let multBy4 = (a) => a * 4;

let endResult = 3 |> add3 |> multBy4;
/* multBy4(add3(3)) */

```

```notes
Also, there's a JS proposal for pipes, I believe it's in STG 2
```
---
export default FullScreenCodeWithTitle

## Modules

```reason
/* Every file also doubles as a module! */
let add2 = a => Math.add(2, a);

/* You can also import everything from a module into a file */
open Math;
let add2 = a => add(2, a);

/* You can also do a "local open" */
let add2 = a => {
  open Math;
  add(2, a);
};

```

```notes
TBH, the "every file is a module" can be awkward at times. I haven't worked on something big enough to run into naming collisions, but I would imagine it forces you to think about how you group modules / when to package stuff into packages.
