## Types in JS Landscape

```notes
Do a quick comparison of Reason vs. TS. 

TS has a smaller learning curve, but you will sacrifice on the guarantee of your type system. In addition, it stays very close to JS language semantics.

On the other hand, compile-to-JS may have a steeper learning curve in favor of more safety and more elegant FP patterns.

```notes

This is a rather complex ecosystem. We're talking about a new language on top of JS, adding
the "learning curve" of a static type system. This can cause us to ask ourselves if it's
even *switch slide* really worth it.
